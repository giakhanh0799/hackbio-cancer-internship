Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health crisis with far-reaching implications across multiple domains, including cancer. The intersection of AMR and cancer poses a significant challenge, as infections caused by resistant pathogens can complicate treatment, increase mortality, and strain healthcare resources.

Cancer patients are particularly susceptible to infections due to their immunocompromised state, which is a consequence of the disease itself and the aggressive treatments used, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. These treatments often lead to neutropenia, a condition characterized by low neutrophil counts, which are important for fighting infections. The frequent use of invasive procedures, prolonged hospital stays and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics further increase the risk of developing infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDROs).

The presence of AMR in cancer patients significantly worsens clinical outcomes. Some of these infections can delay or interrupt cancer treatment, leading to disease progression and reduced survival. For example, febrile neutropenia, a common complication in chemotherapy patients, becomes much more dangerous when pathogens are resistant to first-line antibiotics.

Recent epidemiological trends suggest that AMR is increasing in cancer patients. Several studies have shown that the incidence of MDROs in oncology departments is increasing, due to factors such as antibiotic overuse and selective pressure caused by cancer treatments. Surveillance data also show geographical differences in the types of resistant pathogens encountered in cancer patients, with some regions having higher rates of certain MDROs.

Tackling AMR in cancer care requires a multi-pronged approach. Key strategies include implementing robust infection prevention and control measures, optimizing antibiotic stewardship programs, and developing new antimicrobial therapies. In addition, integrating AMR considerations into cancer treatment regimens is essential to minimize the risk of drug-resistant infections. This may include more judicious use of antibiotics, regular monitoring for drug-resistant pathogens, and the use of preventive measures tailored to the specific needs of cancer patients.

To summarize, AMR is an increasingly important issue in cancer epidemiology, with significant implications for patient outcomes and health care systems. As the incidence of drug-resistant infections in cancer patients continues to rise, it is essential to prioritize efforts to understand, monitor, and mitigate the impact of AMR in oncology. In doing so, we can improve the quality of care for cancer patients and increase their chances of successful treatment.
